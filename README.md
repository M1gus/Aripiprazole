Here, I used Autodock Vina to dock a selection of noncanonical complex I inhibitors including aripiprazole on mitochondrial complex 1. The structure of mitochondrial complex 1 was obtained from Chung *et al.* 2021 (Cork-in-bottle mechanism of inhibitor binding to mammalian complex I). 

All code were run on a Linux server. Modifications will be required for compatibility on Windows or MacOS.

Our paper titled *The antipsychotic medications aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine are off-target respiratory chain complex I inhibitors* will be available soon.
