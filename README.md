Here, we used Autodock Vina to dock Aripiprazole, piericidin and rotenone on mitochondrial complex 1 to investigate their inhibitory potential. The raw structure of mitochondria complex 1 was obtained from Fedor *et al.* 2016 (Correlating kinetic and structural data on ubiquinone
binding and reduction by respiratory complex I). 

Molecular_docking_of_aripiprazole_and_C1_inhibitors.md is the file used to prepared files for docking. 

Our paper will be available soon.
